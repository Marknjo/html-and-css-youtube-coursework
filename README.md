# Become a Complete Web Developer: Learn HTML and CSS by Building a Professional Developer Profile That Gets You Hired

This is a HTML and CSS repo of the YouTube course (Tutorials) I have built at The Talking Dev Channel. We will build a Developer's profile page with only HTML and CSS. No 3rd party integrations.

## Some Quick Notes On Getting Started

No major configuration you will need on this one.

All you need in your editor, [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Plugins

You'll also need the following plugins

- Vs Code [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin
- Vs Code [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) Plugin

Other extra configurations.

- I will be using **Emmet** (It Comes pre-configured in VsCode)
- If you'll like the same font as mine. I am using **Fira Code**. Download it [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) and follow installation instructions.
- I am also using **Cobalt2 Theme**, that makes my VsCode a little better to work with. Here is the download link, ([Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2)).
- When it comes to icons, I am using [VsCode Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons).

_**NB:** I have added **.vscode** dir with extensions.json to help you with these configurations, except for the font. This one you'll have to follow manual installations_

### Requirements

Then you need to start an empty project with only html page _**(index.html)**_ and styles, js, and images folder (more on this later). But if curious, see the final directory.

Finally. you start working on your project.

_Incase anything change, I'll leave a note for you ðŸ˜œ._
